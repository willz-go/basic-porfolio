                <p>This website was build as a part of a project why
                     studying at codecademy. Some of my codes and ideas will be posted here. 
                     I intend to give a general description about each project and maybe I’ll 
                     post some random stuff I’d like to code as well. Anyhow, have a good  one!</p>

                    This one was kinda of a challenge. There was this specification sheet that we were supposed to use as a 
                guide. We would need to research for things we didn't quite know and try to match specification
            as close as you could. I guess I did pretty alright in this one.  </p>

            <h3>And there was more! Many other were executed inside codecademy's environment, so I don't have 
                the code. Maybe someday I'll fetch them, if I have enough time....
